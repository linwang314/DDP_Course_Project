# DDP_Course_Project  

This peer assessed assignment has two parts: 1) create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers and 2) prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application with Slidify or Rstudio Presenter.  

## Shiny Application  

### Tasks  

1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.  
2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server

The application must include the following:  

1. Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)  
2. Some operation on the ui input in sever.R  
3. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations  
4. You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
